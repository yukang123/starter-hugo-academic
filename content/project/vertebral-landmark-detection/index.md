title: Vertebral Landmark Detection on X-ray Images
date: 2022-02-01T11:40:51.069Z
summary: >-
  Normally, clinicians evaluate the curvature of the spine by calculating the
  Cobb angles for scoliosis diagnosis. They should identify vertebrae first and
  then select tilted ones for Cobb angle measurement.\

  To relieve the burden of manual operation, we use machine learning methods to automatically detect vertebral landmarks.
